     <b>Next-generation inflammation imaging combining computational modelling and machine learning</b>
     <br>
     <br>
     This is an exciting opportunity to be considered for an EPSRC funded PhD studentship at UCL departments of Computer Science and Medicine.
     <br>
     <br>
     This project will develop a set of interlinked computational methods, with deep learning as the core technology, aiming to provide detailed, quantitative imaging assessments of inflammation. These tools will focus on (i) the generation of biologically-relevant spatial maps describing key pathophysiological processes in inflammation (ii) the extraction of biologically-meaningful summary metrics, describing the burden and type of disease in each patient and (iii) precise measurement of changes in disease over time.

     <b>Spotting signs of damage in the brain:</b> white matter hyperintensity segmentation from MRI using deep learning
     <br>
     <br>
     This is an exciting opportunity to be considered for an EPSRC funded PhD studentship at UCL department of Computer Science.
     <br>
     <br>
     This project aims to develop novel deep learning-based approaches to assess damage in the brain, and to understand its impact on brain functions, using routine MRI scans.  The damage of particular importance is the damage to white matter, brain's communication pathways; damaged white matter is known as white matter hyperintensity because it appears brighter than healthy white matter in routine MRI scans.  Current approaches to assess this, known as white matter hyperintensity segmentation, identify spatial locations and extent of the damage.  However, this information offers limited value for quantifying the nature of functional impairment.  In particular, they do not inform on the extent to which individual communication pathways supporting specific brain functions have been disrupted.  In this PhD, you will have the opportunity to develop novel approaches that address this limitation using deep learning.
